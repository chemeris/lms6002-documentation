Datasheet 1.2r0
---------------

 1. The purpose of the "LO Leakage" label at the "Figure 1: Functional block diagram" is not to show the path of LO leakage. :) Actually it means "LO Leakage Cancellation" and refers to DACs used for that purpose. Refer to the "Calibration and Initialization" section of the datasheet.

Found an issue? Let me know and I'll try to get it fixed in the next release of documentation.
