Documentation for LMS6002D single chip transceiver
==================================================

Info
----

This documentation is released by Lime Microsystems for the benefit of open-source community. You're free to use it without signing an NDA with Lime Microsystems as long as you develop and open-source project.

Why LMS6002D?
-------------

Because up to my knowledge it's the only highly-integrated wide-band transceiver chip which is friendly to open-source software and open-source hardware. Lime Microsystems support for open-source is not ideal, but they're making great effort to do better. This documentation repository is a part of this effort.
