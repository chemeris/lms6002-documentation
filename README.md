Documentation for LMS6002D single chip transceiver
==================================================

Info
----

This documentation is released by Lime Microsystems for the benefit of open-source community. You're free to use it without signing an NDA with Lime Microsystems as long as you develop and open-source project.

Why LMS6002D?
-------------

Because up to my knowledge it's the only highly-integrated wide-band transceiver chip which is friendly to open-source software and open-source hardware. Lime Microsystems support for open-source is not ideal, but they're making great effort to do better. This documentation repository is a part of this effort.

 * [LMS6002Dr2-DataSheet-1.2r0.pdf][1] (5 June 2012) - LMS6002D datasheet.
 * [LMS6002Dr2-Programming and Calibration Guide-1.1r1.pdf][2] (19 July 2011) - LMS6002D Programming and Calibration Guide. Also contains description of calibration procedures.
 * [LMS6002Dr2-Quick Starter Manual-EVB_5_r2.3.pdf][3] (11 May 2012) - Quick Starter Manual for the [LMS6002D evaluation board][EVB]. Contains useful instructions for manual LO leakage and I/Q imbalance calibration.
 * [LMS6002D-FAQ-1.0r7.pdf][4] (16 July 2012) - Answers to Frequency Asked Questions. Don't miss this.
 * [LMS6002Dr2-Improving transceiver performance using digital techniques-1.0r1.pdf][5] - Shows how to cancel TX LO leakage and compensate RX IP2 and TX I/Q imbalance in baseband.
 * [LMS6002D-Temperature testing July 2011.pdf][6] - Measurements of the chip performance vs. temperature and frequency.
 * [LMS6002Dr2-RF LoopBack Response.pdf][7] - The document shows the frequency response of different RF Loopback. Adjusting the Tx/Rx gain stages you can make the frequency response to be flat up to 2.9 GHz for LNA1/2.
